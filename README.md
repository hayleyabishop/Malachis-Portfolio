# Malachis-Portfolio

Hello, 
This is my portfolio for technical writing. Thank you for taking the time to check out some of my work.

Currently, I have two projects made public.

First, I have a tutorial for a free video editor called OpenShot. I created the tutorial in Markdown. My goal with the tutorial was to explain the basic functionality and capabilities of the software. I focused on clear textual explanation with supplementary images that would help to clarify some of the visual clutter within the software. 

Second, I have a README I created for a Discord bot made by a friend of mine. I created the README in Markdown. My goal with the README was to replicate the look and sophistication of other more popular READMEs in the GitHub community while still maintaining the casual vibe associated with Discord. I focused on embedding links naturally within the text and making parameters inserted by users clear and intuitive.
